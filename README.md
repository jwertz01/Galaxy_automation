This script is dependant on bioblend just do a pip install bioblend and that should work.

Note that you must create and populate a file called api.key (unless you change the name in the configuration.ini file) The api.key file should have your galaxy api key first line, nothing else

You will also need to copy configuration.example.ini and adjust it for your use of Galaxy.  Most of the time you should only have to edit configuration.ini file once.
